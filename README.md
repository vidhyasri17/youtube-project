# Introduction

YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project that aims to allow users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. The project utilizes postgreSQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit to create a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, store, and query YouTube channel and video data.

## Problem Statement 
The task is to build a Streamlit app that permits users to analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. Users can input a YouTube channel ID to access data like channel information, video details, and user engagement. The app should facilitate storing the data in a MongoDB database and allow users to collect data from up to 10 different channels. Additionally, it should offer the capability to migrate selected channel data from the data lake to a postgresql database for further analysis. The app should enable searching and retrieval of data from the postgreSQL database, including advanced options like joining tables for comprehensive channel information.

## Technology Stack Used
1. Python
2. postgresql
3. MongoDB
4. Google Client Library 
5. vs code


# Conclusion

The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project provides a powerful tool for retrieving, storing, and analyzing YouTube channel and video data. By leveraging postgreSQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit, users can easily access and manipulate YouTube data in a user-friendly interface. The project offers flexibility, scalability, and data visualization capabilities, empowering users to gain insights from the vast amount of YouTube data available.
